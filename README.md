ProxmarkWrapper
======

ProxmarkWrapper is a wrapper around the proxmark client that will send a text alert (and/or email if warranted) if a RFID card is captured

### Usage:
```bash
proxmarkWrapper.py -h
proxmarkWrapper.py -l /dev/ttyACM0
proxmarkWrapper.py -l /dev/tty.PM3_RDV40-DevB
```

My Python is rusty so if you see any areas for improvement (which I know there are) feel free to do a pull request and we'll get it added in!

###### Props
As always, thank to Iceman (@herrmann1001) and all the great people who are actively working on the Proxmark project to continually make it better
